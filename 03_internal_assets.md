# Internal assets

Several assets can be created by Unity, without having to be imported:

1. Scenes.
2. Animations.
3. Materials.
This affects how lighting affects an object.
4. Scripts.
5. Prefabs.
Blueprints for objects that can be generated at runtime.

Right clicking the project assets section of the interface>create allows one to browse the various internal objects Unity can create.
