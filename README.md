# TestUnity

A Unity testing playground.

# Setup

1. Install Unity Hub here: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download

After installation, first time users will need to create a Unity id to get a license. After confirming the email and logging in, choose a personal license.

2. Using unity hub, go to installs>add and choose a unity version. Normally default is fine. If you need an old version to support a pre existing project, select it from: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive

3. Once installation is complete, go to projects>new to start a new project. Just go with the 3d template and create. You may return to projects in Unity Hub at any time to open a created project.
