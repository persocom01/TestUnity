# Object parenting

In unity, objects follow a Hierarchy system. In this system, objects can become "parents" of other objects. Being a child of a object means your transforms will be relative to your parent.

For instance, the turret of a tank is always positioned on top of the tanks's main body. In this case the body of the tank is the parent and the turret is the child. This not only applies to position transforms, but also to scale.
